### Precheck

* For support use https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma-support or [community channels](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma#community-channels).
* Please do a quick search to ensure no similar bug has been reported before. If the bug has not been addressed after 2 weeks, it's fine to bump it.
* Try to ensure that the bug is actually related to the Pleroma backend. For example, if a bug happens in Pleroma-FE but not in Mastodon-FE or mobile clients, it's likely that the bug should be filed in [Pleroma-FE](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma-fe/issues/new) repository.
