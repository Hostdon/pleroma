# Configuration Cheat Sheet

This is a cheat sheet for Pleroma configuration file, any setting possible to configure should be listed here.

For OTP installations the configuration is typically stored in `/etc/pleroma/config.exs`.

For from source installations Pleroma configuration works by first importing the base config `config/config.exs`, then overriding it by the environment config `config/$MIX_ENV.exs` and then overriding it by user config `config/$MIX_ENV.secret.exs`. In from source installations you should always make the changes to the user config and NEVER to the base config to avoid breakages and merge conflicts. So for production you change/add configuration to `config/prod.secret.exs`.

To add configuration to your config file, you can copy it from the base config. The latest version of it can be viewed [here](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/config/config.exs). You can also use this file if you don't know how an option is supposed to be formatted.

* `http` - a list containing http protocol configuration, all configuration options can be viewed [here](https://hexdocs.pm/plug_cowboy/Plug.Cowboy.html#module-options), only common options are listed here. For deployment using docker, you need to set this to `[ip: {0,0,0,0}, port: 4000]` to make pleroma accessible from other containers (such as your nginx server).
  - `ip` - a tuple consisting of 4 integers
  - `port`

### Pleroma.Web.Plugs.RemoteIp

!!! warning
    If your instance is not behind at least one reverse proxy, you should not enable this plug.

`Pleroma.Web.Plugs.RemoteIp` is a shim to call [`RemoteIp`](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/remote_ip) but with runtime configuration.

Available options:

* `enabled` - Enable/disable the plug. Defaults to `false`.
* `headers` - A list of strings naming the HTTP headers to use when deriving the true client IP address. Defaults to `["x-forwarded-for"]`.
* `proxies` - A list of upstream proxy IP subnets in CIDR notation from which we will parse the content of `headers`. Defaults to `[]`. IPv4 entries without a bitmask will be assumed to be /32 and IPv6 /128.
* `reserved` - A list of reserved IP subnets in CIDR notation which should be ignored if found in `headers`. Defaults to `["127.0.0.0/8", "::1/128", "fc00::/7", "10.0.0.0/8", "172.16.0.0/12", "192.168.0.0/16"]`.


### :rate_limit

!!! note
   If your instance is behind a reverse proxy ensure [`Pleroma.Web.Plugs.RemoteIp`](#pleroma-plugs-remoteip) is enabled (it is enabled by default).

A keyword list of rate limiters where a key is a limiter name and value is the limiter configuration. The basic configuration is a tuple where:

* The first element: `scale` (Integer). The time scale in milliseconds.
* The second element: `limit` (Integer). How many requests to limit in the time scale provided.

It is also possible to have different limits for unauthenticated and authenticated users: the keyword value must be a list of two tuples where the first one is a config for unauthenticated users and the second one is for authenticated.

For example:

```elixir
config :pleroma, :rate_limit,
  authentication: {60_000, 15},
  search: [{1000, 10}, {1000, 30}]
```

Means that:

1. In 60 seconds, 15 authentication attempts can be performed from the same IP address.
2. In 1 second, 10 search requests can be performed from the same IP adress by unauthenticated users, while authenticated users can perform 30 search requests per second.

Supported rate limiters:

* `:search` - Account/Status search.
* `:timeline` - Timeline requests (each timeline has it's own limiter).
* `:app_account_creation` - Account registration from the API.
* `:relations_actions` - Following/Unfollowing in general.
* `:relation_id_action` - Following/Unfollowing for a specific user.
* `:statuses_actions` - Status actions such as: (un)repeating, (un)favouriting, creating, deleting.
* `:status_id_action` - (un)Repeating/(un)Favouriting a particular status.
* `:authentication` - Authentication actions, i.e getting an OAuth token.
* `:password_reset` - Requesting password reset emails.
* `:account_confirmation_resend` - Requesting resending account confirmation emails.
* `:ap_routes` - Requesting statuses via ActivityPub.

### :web_cache_ttl

The expiration time for the web responses cache. Values should be in milliseconds or `nil` to disable expiration.

Available caches:

* `:activity_pub` - activity pub routes (except question activities). Defaults to `nil` (no expiration).
* `:activity_pub_question` - activity pub routes (question activities). Defaults to `30_000` (30 seconds).

## HTTP client

### :http

* `proxy_url`: an upstream proxy to fetch posts and/or media with, (default: `nil`)
* `send_user_agent`: should we include a user agent with HTTP requests? (default: `true`)
* `user_agent`: what user agent should we use? (default: `:default`), must be string or `:default`
* `adapter`: array of adapter options

Advanced. Tweaks Hackney (http client) connections pools.

There's three pools used:

* `:federation` for the federation jobs.
  You may want this pool max_connections to be at least equal to the number of federator jobs + retry queue jobs.
* `:media` for rich media, media proxy
* `:upload` for uploaded media (if using a remote uploader and `proxy_remote: true`)

For each pool, the options are:

* `max_connections` - how much connections a pool can hold
* `timeout` - retention duration for connections


### :connections_pool

*For `gun` adapter*

Settings for HTTP connection pool.

* `:connection_acquisition_wait` - Timeout to acquire a connection from pool.The total max time is this value multiplied by the number of retries.
* `connection_acquisition_retries` - Number of attempts to acquire the connection from the pool if it is overloaded. Each attempt is timed `:connection_acquisition_wait` apart.
* `:max_connections` - Maximum number of connections in the pool.
* `:connect_timeout` - Timeout to connect to the host.
* `:reclaim_multiplier` - Multiplied by `:max_connections` this will be the maximum number of idle connections that will be reclaimed in case the pool is overloaded.

### :pools

*For `gun` adapter*

Settings for request pools. These pools are limited on top of `:connections_pool`.

There are four pools used:

* `:federation` for the federation jobs. You may want this pool's max_connections to be at least equal to the number of federator jobs + retry queue jobs.
* `:media` - for rich media, media proxy.
* `:upload` - for proxying media when a remote uploader is used and `proxy_remote: true`.
* `:default` - for other requests.

For each pool, the options are:

* `:size` - limit to how much requests can be concurrently executed.
* `:recv_timeout` - timeout while `gun` will wait for response
* `:max_waiting` - limit to how much requests can be waiting for others to finish, after this is reached, subsequent requests will be dropped.

## Captcha

### Pleroma.Captcha

* `enabled`: Whether the captcha should be shown on registration.
* `method`: The method/service to use for captcha.
* `seconds_valid`: The time in seconds for which the captcha is valid.

### Captcha providers

#### Pleroma.Captcha.Native

A built-in captcha provider. Enabled by default.

#### Pleroma.Captcha.Kocaptcha

Kocaptcha is a very simple captcha service with a single API endpoint,
the source code is here: [kocaptcha](https://github.com/koto-bank/kocaptcha). The default endpoint
`https://captcha.kotobank.ch` is hosted by the developer.

* `endpoint`: the Kocaptcha endpoint to use.

## Uploads

### Pleroma.Upload

* `uploader`: Which one of the [uploaders](#uploaders) to use.
* `filters`: List of [upload filters](#upload-filters) to use.
* `link_name`: When enabled Pleroma will add a `name` parameter to the url of the upload, for example `https://instance.tld/media/corndog.png?name=corndog.png`. This is needed to provide the correct filename in Content-Disposition headers when using filters like `Pleroma.Upload.Filter.Dedupe`
* `base_url`: The base URL to access a user-uploaded file. Useful when you want to host the media files via another domain or are using a 3rd party S3 provider.
* `proxy_remote`: If you're using a remote uploader, Pleroma will proxy media requests instead of redirecting to it.
* `proxy_opts`: Proxy options, see `Pleroma.ReverseProxy` documentation.
* `filename_display_max_length`: Set max length of a filename to display. 0 = no limit. Default: 30.
* `default_description`: Sets which default description an image has if none is set explicitly. Options: nil (default) - Don't set a default, :filename - use the filename of the file, a string (e.g. "attachment") - Use this string

!!! warning
    `strip_exif` has been replaced by `Pleroma.Upload.Filter.Mogrify`.

### Uploaders

#### Pleroma.Uploaders.Local

* `uploads`: Which directory to store the user-uploads in, relative to pleroma’s working directory.

#### Pleroma.Uploaders.S3

Don't forget to configure [Ex AWS S3](#ex-aws-s3-settings)

* `bucket`: S3 bucket name.
* `bucket_namespace`: S3 bucket namespace.
* `truncated_namespace`: If you use S3 compatible service such as Digital Ocean Spaces or CDN, set folder name or "" etc.
* `streaming_enabled`: Enable streaming uploads, when enabled the file will be sent to the server in chunks as it's being read. This may be unsupported by some providers, try disabling this if you have upload problems.

#### Ex AWS S3 settings

* `access_key_id`: Access key ID
* `secret_access_key`: Secret access key
* `host`: S3 host

Example:

```elixir
config :ex_aws, :s3,
  access_key_id: "xxxxxxxxxx",
  secret_access_key: "yyyyyyyyyy",
  host: "s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com"
```

### Upload filters

#### Pleroma.Upload.Filter.AnonymizeFilename

This filter replaces the filename (not the path) of an upload. For complete obfuscation, add
`Pleroma.Upload.Filter.Dedupe` before AnonymizeFilename.

* `text`: Text to replace filenames in links. If empty, `{random}.extension` will be used. You can get the original filename extension by using `{extension}`, for example `custom-file-name.{extension}`.

#### Pleroma.Upload.Filter.Dedupe

No specific configuration.

#### Pleroma.Upload.Filter.Exiftool

This filter only strips the GPS and location metadata with Exiftool leaving color profiles and attributes intact.

No specific configuration.

#### Pleroma.Upload.Filter.Mogrify

* `args`: List of actions for the `mogrify` command like `"strip"` or `["strip", "auto-orient", {"implode", "1"}]`.

## Email

### Pleroma.Emails.Mailer
* `adapter`: one of the mail adapters listed in [Swoosh readme](https://github.com/swoosh/swoosh#adapters), or `Swoosh.Adapters.Local` for in-memory mailbox.
* `api_key` / `password` and / or other adapter-specific settings, per the above documentation.
* `enabled`: Allows enable/disable send  emails. Default: `false`.

An example for Sendgrid adapter:

```elixir
config :pleroma, Pleroma.Emails.Mailer,
  enabled: true,
  adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.Sendgrid,
  api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

An example for SMTP adapter:

```elixir
config :pleroma, Pleroma.Emails.Mailer,
  enabled: true,
  adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.SMTP,
  relay: "smtp.gmail.com",
  username: "YOUR_USERNAME@gmail.com",
  password: "YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD",
  port: 465,
  ssl: true,
  auth: :always
```

### :email_notifications

Email notifications settings.

  - digest - emails of "what you've missed" for users who have been
    inactive for a while.
    - active: globally enable or disable digest emails
    - schedule: When to send digest email, in [crontab format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).
      "0 0 * * 0" is the default, meaning "once a week at midnight on Sunday morning"
    - interval: Minimum interval between digest emails to one user
    - inactivity_threshold: Minimum user inactivity threshold

### Pleroma.Emails.UserEmail

- `:logo` - a path to a custom logo. Set it to `nil` to use the default Pleroma logo.
- `:styling` - a map with color settings for email templates.

### Pleroma.Emails.NewUsersDigestEmail

- `:enabled` - a boolean, enables new users admin digest email when `true`. Defaults to `false`.

## Background jobs

### Oban

[Oban](https://github.com/sorentwo/oban) asynchronous job processor configuration.

Configuration options described in [Oban readme](https://github.com/sorentwo/oban#usage):

* `repo` - app's Ecto repo (`Pleroma.Repo`)
* `log` - logs verbosity
* `queues` - job queues (see below)
* `crontab` - periodic jobs, see [`Oban.Cron`](#obancron)

Pleroma has the following queues:

* `activity_expiration` - Activity expiration
* `federator_outgoing` - Outgoing federation
* `federator_incoming` - Incoming federation
* `mailer` - Email sender, see [`Pleroma.Emails.Mailer`](#pleromaemailsmailer)
* `transmogrifier` - Transmogrifier
* `web_push` - Web push notifications
* `scheduled_activities` - Scheduled activities, see [`Pleroma.ScheduledActivity`](#pleromascheduledactivity)

#### Oban.Cron

Pleroma has these periodic job workers:

* `Pleroma.Workers.Cron.DigestEmailsWorker` - digest emails for users with new mentions and follows
* `Pleroma.Workers.Cron.NewUsersDigestWorker` - digest emails for admins with new registrations

```elixir
config :pleroma, Oban,
  repo: Pleroma.Repo,
  verbose: false,
  prune: {:maxlen, 1500},
  queues: [
    federator_incoming: 50,
    federator_outgoing: 50
  ],
  crontab: [
    {"0 0 * * 0", Pleroma.Workers.Cron.DigestEmailsWorker},
    {"0 0 * * *", Pleroma.Workers.Cron.NewUsersDigestWorker}
  ]
```

This config contains two queues: `federator_incoming` and `federator_outgoing`. Both have the number of max concurrent jobs set to `50`.

#### Migrating `pleroma_job_queue` settings

`config :pleroma_job_queue, :queues` is replaced by `config :pleroma, Oban, :queues` and uses the same format (keys are queues' names, values are max concurrent jobs numbers).

### :workers

Includes custom worker options not interpretable directly by `Oban`.

* `retries` — keyword lists where keys are `Oban` queues (see above) and values are numbers of max attempts for failed jobs.

Example:

```elixir
config :pleroma, :workers,
  retries: [
    federator_incoming: 5,
    federator_outgoing: 5
  ]
```

#### Migrating `Pleroma.Web.Federator.RetryQueue` settings

* `max_retries` is replaced with `config :pleroma, :workers, retries: [federator_outgoing: 5]`
* `enabled: false` corresponds to `config :pleroma, :workers, retries: [federator_outgoing: 1]`
* deprecated options: `max_jobs`, `initial_timeout`

## :web_push_encryption, :vapid_details

Web Push Notifications configuration. You can use the mix task `mix web_push.gen.keypair` to generate it.

* ``subject``: a mailto link for the administrative contact. It’s best if this email is not a personal email address, but rather a group email so that if a person leaves an organization, is unavailable for an extended period, or otherwise can’t respond, someone else on the list can.
* ``public_key``: VAPID public key
* ``private_key``: VAPID private key

## :logger
* `backends`: `:console` is used to send logs to stdout, `{ExSyslogger, :ex_syslogger}` to log to syslog, and `Quack.Logger` to log to Slack

An example to enable ONLY ExSyslogger (f/ex in ``prod.secret.exs``) with info and debug suppressed:
```elixir
config :logger,
  backends: [{ExSyslogger, :ex_syslogger}]

config :logger, :ex_syslogger,
  level: :warn
```

Another example, keeping console output and adding the pid to syslog output:
```elixir
config :logger,
  backends: [:console, {ExSyslogger, :ex_syslogger}]

config :logger, :ex_syslogger,
  level: :warn,
  option: [:pid, :ndelay]
```

See: [logger’s documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/logger/Logger.html) and [ex_syslogger’s documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_syslogger/)

An example of logging info to local syslog, but warn to a Slack channel:
```elixir
config :logger,
  backends: [ {ExSyslogger, :ex_syslogger}, Quack.Logger ],
  level: :info

config :logger, :ex_syslogger,
  level: :info,
  ident: "pleroma",
  format: "$metadata[$level] $message"

config :quack,
  level: :warn,
  meta: [:all],
  webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"
```

See the [Quack Github](https://github.com/azohra/quack) for more details



## Database options

### RUM indexing for full text search

!!! warning
    It is recommended to use PostgreSQL v11 or newer. We have seen some minor issues with lower PostgreSQL versions.

* `rum_enabled`: If RUM indexes should be used. Defaults to `false`.

RUM indexes are an alternative indexing scheme that is not included in PostgreSQL by default. While they may eventually be mainlined, for now they have to be installed as a PostgreSQL extension from https://github.com/postgrespro/rum.

Their advantage over the standard GIN indexes is that they allow efficient ordering of search results by timestamp, which makes search queries a lot faster on larger servers, by one or two orders of magnitude. They take up around 3 times as much space as GIN indexes.

To enable them, both the `rum_enabled` flag has to be set and the following special migration has to be run:

`mix ecto.migrate --migrations-path priv/repo/optional_migrations/rum_indexing/`

This will probably take a long time.

## Alternative client protocols

### BBS / SSH access

To enable simple command line interface accessible over ssh, add a setting like this to your configuration file:

```exs
app_dir = File.cwd!
priv_dir = Path.join([app_dir, "priv/ssh_keys"])

config :esshd,
  enabled: true,
  priv_dir: priv_dir,
  handler: "Pleroma.BBS.Handler",
  port: 10_022,
  password_authenticator: "Pleroma.BBS.Authenticator"
```

Feel free to adjust the priv_dir and port number. Then you will have to create the key for the keys (in the example `priv/ssh_keys`) and create the host keys with `ssh-keygen -m PEM -N "" -b 2048 -t rsa -f ssh_host_rsa_key`. After restarting, you should be able to connect to your Pleroma instance with `ssh username@server -p $PORT`

### :gopher
* `enabled`: Enables the gopher interface
* `ip`: IP address to bind to
* `port`: Port to bind to
* `dstport`: Port advertised in urls (optional, defaults to `port`)


## Authentication

### :admin_token

Allows to set a token that can be used to authenticate with the admin api without using an actual user by giving it as the `admin_token` parameter or `x-admin-token` HTTP header. Example:

```elixir
config :pleroma, :admin_token, "somerandomtoken"
```

You can then do

```shell
curl "http://localhost:4000/api/v1/pleroma/admin/users/invites?admin_token=somerandomtoken"
```

or

```shell
curl -H "X-Admin-Token: somerandomtoken" "http://localhost:4000/api/v1/pleroma/admin/users/invites"
```

Warning: it's discouraged to use this feature because of the associated security risk: static / rarely changed instance-wide token is much weaker compared to email-password pair of a real admin user; consider using HTTP Basic Auth or OAuth-based authentication instead.

### :auth

Authentication / authorization settings.

* `auth_template`: authentication form template. By default it's `show.html` which corresponds to `lib/pleroma/web/templates/o_auth/o_auth/show.html.eex`.
* `oauth_consumer_template`: OAuth consumer mode authentication form template. By default it's `consumer.html` which corresponds to `lib/pleroma/web/templates/o_auth/o_auth/consumer.html.eex`.
* `oauth_consumer_strategies`: the list of enabled OAuth consumer strategies; by default it's set by `OAUTH_CONSUMER_STRATEGIES` environment variable. Each entry in this space-delimited string should be of format `<strategy>` or `<strategy>:<dependency>` (e.g. `twitter` or `keycloak:ueberauth_keycloak_strategy` in case dependency is named differently than `ueberauth_<strategy>`).

### Pleroma.Web.Auth.Authenticator

* `Pleroma.Web.Auth.PleromaAuthenticator`: default database authenticator.
* `Pleroma.Web.Auth.LDAPAuthenticator`: LDAP authentication.

### :ldap

Use LDAP for user authentication.  When a user logs in to the Pleroma
instance, the name and password will be verified by trying to authenticate
(bind) to an LDAP server.  If a user exists in the LDAP directory but there
is no account with the same name yet on the Pleroma instance then a new
Pleroma account will be created with the same name as the LDAP user name.

* `enabled`: enables LDAP authentication
* `host`: LDAP server hostname
* `port`: LDAP port, e.g. 389 or 636
* `ssl`: true to use SSL, usually implies the port 636
* `sslopts`: additional SSL options
* `tls`: true to start TLS, usually implies the port 389
* `tlsopts`: additional TLS options
* `base`: LDAP base, e.g. "dc=example,dc=com"
* `uid`: LDAP attribute name to authenticate the user, e.g. when "cn", the filter will be "cn=username,base"

Note, if your LDAP server is an Active Directory server the correct value is commonly `uid: "cn"`, but if you use an
OpenLDAP server the value may be `uid: "uid"`.

### :oauth2 (Pleroma as OAuth 2.0 provider settings)

OAuth 2.0 provider settings:

* `token_expires_in` - The lifetime in seconds of the access token.
* `issue_new_refresh_token` - Keeps old refresh token or generate new refresh token when to obtain an access token.
* `clean_expired_tokens` - Enable a background job to clean expired oauth tokens. Defaults to `false`.

OAuth 2.0 provider and related endpoints:

* `POST /api/v1/apps` creates client app basing on provided params.
* `GET/POST /oauth/authorize` renders/submits authorization form.
* `POST /oauth/token` creates/renews OAuth token.
* `POST /oauth/revoke` revokes provided OAuth token.
* `GET /api/v1/accounts/verify_credentials` (with proper `Authorization` header or `access_token` URI param) returns user info on requester (with `acct` field containing local nickname and `fqn` field containing fully-qualified nickname which could generally be used as email stub for OAuth software that demands email field in identity endpoint response, like Peertube).

### OAuth consumer mode

OAuth consumer mode allows sign in / sign up via external OAuth providers (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc.).
Implementation is based on Ueberauth; see the list of [available strategies](https://github.com/ueberauth/ueberauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies).

!!! note
    Each strategy is shipped as a separate dependency; in order to get the strategies, run `OAUTH_CONSUMER_STRATEGIES="..." mix deps.get`, e.g. `OAUTH_CONSUMER_STRATEGIES="twitter facebook google microsoft" mix deps.get`.  The server should also be started with `OAUTH_CONSUMER_STRATEGIES="..." mix phx.server` in case you enable any strategies.

!!! note
    Each strategy requires separate setup (on external provider side and Pleroma side). Below are the guidelines on setting up most popular strategies.

!!! note
    Make sure that `"SameSite=Lax"` is set in `extra_cookie_attrs` when you have this feature enabled. OAuth consumer mode will not work with `"SameSite=Strict"`

* For Twitter, [register an app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps), configure callback URL to https://<your_host>/oauth/twitter/callback

* For Facebook, [register an app](https://developers.facebook.com/apps), configure callback URL to https://<your_host>/oauth/facebook/callback, enable Facebook Login service at https://developers.facebook.com/apps/<app_id>/fb-login/settings/

* For Google, [register an app](https://console.developers.google.com), configure callback URL to https://<your_host>/oauth/google/callback

* For Microsoft, [register an app](https://portal.azure.com), configure callback URL to https://<your_host>/oauth/microsoft/callback

Once the app is configured on external OAuth provider side, add app's credentials and strategy-specific settings (if any — e.g. see Microsoft below) to `config/prod.secret.exs`,
per strategy's documentation (e.g. [ueberauth_twitter](https://github.com/ueberauth/ueberauth_twitter)). Example config basing on environment variables:

```elixir
# Twitter
config :ueberauth, Ueberauth.Strategy.Twitter.OAuth,
  consumer_key: System.get_env("TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY"),
  consumer_secret: System.get_env("TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET")

# Facebook
config :ueberauth, Ueberauth.Strategy.Facebook.OAuth,
  client_id: System.get_env("FACEBOOK_APP_ID"),
  client_secret: System.get_env("FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET"),
  redirect_uri: System.get_env("FACEBOOK_REDIRECT_URI")

# Google
config :ueberauth, Ueberauth.Strategy.Google.OAuth,
  client_id: System.get_env("GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"),
  client_secret: System.get_env("GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"),
  redirect_uri: System.get_env("GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI")

# Microsoft
config :ueberauth, Ueberauth.Strategy.Microsoft.OAuth,
  client_id: System.get_env("MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID"),
  client_secret: System.get_env("MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET")

config :ueberauth, Ueberauth,
  providers: [
    microsoft: {Ueberauth.Strategy.Microsoft, [callback_params: []]}
  ]

# Keycloak
# Note: make sure to add `keycloak:ueberauth_keycloak_strategy` entry to `OAUTH_CONSUMER_STRATEGIES` environment variable
keycloak_url = "https://publicly-reachable-keycloak-instance.org:8080"

config :ueberauth, Ueberauth.Strategy.Keycloak.OAuth,
  client_id: System.get_env("KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID"),
  client_secret: System.get_env("KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET"),
  site: keycloak_url,
  authorize_url: "#{keycloak_url}/auth/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/auth",
  token_url: "#{keycloak_url}/auth/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token",
  userinfo_url: "#{keycloak_url}/auth/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo",
  token_method: :post

config :ueberauth, Ueberauth,
  providers: [
    keycloak: {Ueberauth.Strategy.Keycloak, [uid_field: :email]}
  ]
```

## Link parsing

### :uri_schemes
* `valid_schemes`: List of the scheme part that is considered valid to be an URL.

### Pleroma.Formatter

Configuration for Pleroma's link formatter which parses mentions, hashtags, and URLs.

* `class` - specify the class to be added to the generated link (default: `false`)
* `rel` - specify the rel attribute (default: `ugc`)
* `new_window` - adds `target="_blank"` attribute (default: `false`)
* `truncate` - Set to a number to truncate URLs longer then the number. Truncated URLs will end in `...` (default: `false`)
* `strip_prefix` - Strip the scheme prefix (default: `false`)
* `extra` - link URLs with rarely used schemes (magnet, ipfs, irc, etc.) (default: `true`)
* `validate_tld` - Set to false to disable TLD validation for URLs/emails. Can be set to :no_scheme to validate TLDs only for urls without a scheme (e.g `example.com` will be validated, but `http://example.loki` won't) (default: `:no_scheme`)

Example:

```elixir
config :pleroma, Pleroma.Formatter,
  class: false,
  rel: "ugc",
  new_window: false,
  truncate: false,
  strip_prefix: false,
  extra: true,
  validate_tld: :no_scheme
```

## Custom Runtime Modules (`:modules`)

* `runtime_dir`: A path to custom Elixir modules (such as MRF policies).

## :configurable_from_database

Boolean, enables/disables in-database configuration. Read [Transfering the config to/from the database](../administration/CLI_tasks/config.md) for more information.

## :database_config_whitelist

List of valid configuration sections which are allowed to be configured from the
database. Settings stored in the database before the whitelist is configured are
still applied, so it is suggested to only use the whitelist on instances that
have not migrated the config to the database.

Example:
```elixir
config :pleroma, :database_config_whitelist, [
  {:pleroma, :instance},
  {:pleroma, Pleroma.Web.Metadata},
  {:auto_linker}
]
```

### Multi-factor authentication -  :two_factor_authentication
* `totp` - a list containing TOTP configuration
  - `digits` - Determines the length of a one-time pass-code in characters. Defaults to 6 characters.
  - `period` - a period for which the TOTP code will be valid in seconds. Defaults to 30 seconds.
* `backup_codes` - a list containing backup codes configuration
  - `number` - number of backup codes to generate.
  - `length` - backup code length. Defaults to 16 characters.

## Restrict entities access for unauthenticated users

### :restrict_unauthenticated

Restrict access for unauthenticated users to timelines (public and federated), user profiles and statuses.

* `timelines`: public and federated timelines
  * `local`: public timeline
  * `federated`: federated timeline (includes public timeline)
* `profiles`: user profiles
  * `local`
  * `remote`
* `activities`: statuses
  * `local`
  * `remote`

Note: when `:instance, :public` is set to `false`, all `:restrict_unauthenticated` items be effectively set to `true` by default. If you'd like to allow unauthenticated access to specific API endpoints on a private instance, please explicitly set `:restrict_unauthenticated` to non-default value in `config/prod.secret.exs`.

Note: setting `restrict_unauthenticated/timelines/local` to `true` has no practical sense if `restrict_unauthenticated/timelines/federated` is set to `false` (since local public activities will still be delivered to unauthenticated users as part of federated timeline).

## Pleroma.Web.ApiSpec.CastAndValidate

* `:strict` a boolean, enables strict input validation (useful in development, not recommended in production). Defaults to `false`.

## :instances_favicons

Control favicons for instances.

* `enabled`: Allow/disallow displaying and getting instances favicons

## Pleroma.User.Backup

!!! note
    Requires enabled email

* `:purge_after_days` an integer, remove backup achives after N days.
* `:limit_days` an integer, limit user to export not more often than once per N days.
* `:dir` a string with a path to backup temporary directory or `nil` to let Pleroma choose temporary directory in the following order:
    1. the directory named by the TMPDIR environment variable
    2. the directory named by the TEMP environment variable
    3. the directory named by the TMP environment variable
    4. C:\TMP on Windows or /tmp on Unix-like operating systems
    5. as a last resort, the current working directory

## Frontend management

Frontends in Pleroma are swappable - you can specify which one to use here.

You can set a frontends for the key `primary` and `admin` and the options of `name` and `ref`. This will then make Pleroma serve the frontend from a folder constructed by concatenating the instance static path, `frontends` and the name and ref.

The key `primary` refers to the frontend that will be served by default for general requests. The key `admin` refers to the frontend that will be served at the `/pleroma/admin` path.

If you don't set anything here, the bundled frontends will be used.

Example:

```
config :pleroma, :frontends,
  primary: %{
    "name" => "pleroma",
    "ref" => "stable"
  },
  admin: %{
    "name" => "admin",
    "ref" => "develop"
  }
```

This would serve the frontend from the the folder at `$instance_static/frontends/pleroma/stable`. You have to copy the frontend into this folder yourself. You can choose the name and ref any way you like, but they will be used by mix tasks to automate installation in the future, the name referring to the project and the ref referring to a commit.

## Ephemeral activities (Pleroma.Workers.PurgeExpiredActivity)

Settings to enable and configure expiration for ephemeral activities

* `:enabled` - enables ephemeral activities creation
* `:min_lifetime` - minimum lifetime for ephemeral activities (in seconds). Default: 10 minutes.

## ConcurrentLimiter

Settings to restrict concurrently running jobs. Jobs which can be configured:

* `Pleroma.Web.RichMedia.Helpers` - generating link previews of URLs in activities
* `Pleroma.Web.ActivityPub.MRF.MediaProxyWarmingPolicy` - warming remote media cache via MediaProxyWarmingPolicy

Each job has these settings:

* `:max_running` - max concurrently runnings jobs
* `:max_waiting` - max waiting jobs
