Every command should be ran as the `akkoma` user from it's home directory. For example if you are superuser, you would have to wrap the command in `su akkoma -s $SHELL -lc "$COMMAND"`.

??? note "From source note about `MIX_ENV`"

     The `mix` command should be prefixed with the name of environment your Akkoma server is running in, usually it's `MIX_ENV=prod`
