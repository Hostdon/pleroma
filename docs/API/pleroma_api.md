# Pleroma API

Requests that require it can be authenticated with [an OAuth token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749), the `_pleroma_key` cookie, or [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization).

Request parameters can be passed via [query strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) or as [form data](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html). Files must be uploaded as `multipart/form-data`.

# Pleroma Conversations

Pleroma Conversations have the same general structure that Mastodon Conversations have. The behavior differs in the following ways when using these endpoints:

1. Pleroma Conversations never add or remove recipients, unless explicitly changed by the user.
2. Pleroma Conversations statuses can be requested by Conversation id.
3. Pleroma Conversations can be replied to.

Conversations have the additional field `recipients` under the `pleroma` key. This holds a list of all the accounts that will receive a message in this conversation.

The status posting endpoint takes an additional parameter, `in_reply_to_conversation_id`, which, when set, will set the visiblity to direct and address only the people who are the recipients of that Conversation.

⚠ Conversation IDs can be found in direct messages with the `pleroma.direct_conversation_id` key, do not confuse it with `pleroma.conversation_id`.

## `GET /api/v1/pleroma/conversations/:id/statuses`
