# Differences in Mastodon API responses from vanilla Mastodon

A Pleroma instance can be identified by "<Mastodon version> (compatible; Pleroma <version>)" present in `version` field in response from `/api/v1/instance`

## Flake IDs

Pleroma uses 128-bit ids as opposed to Mastodon's 64 bits. However, just like Mastodon's ids, they are lexically sortable strings

## Timelines

Adding the parameter `with_muted=true` to the timeline queries will also return activities by muted (not by blocked!) users.

Adding the parameter `exclude_visibilities` to the timeline queries will exclude the statuses with the given visibilities. The parameter accepts an array of visibility types (`public`, `unlisted`, `private`, `direct`), e.g., `exclude_visibilities[]=direct&exclude_visibilities[]=private`.

Adding the parameter `reply_visibility` to the public and home timelines queries will filter replies. Possible values: without parameter (default) shows all replies, `following` - replies directed to you or users you follow, `self` - replies directed to you.

Adding the parameter `instance=lain.com` to the public timeline will show only statuses originating from `lain.com` (or any remote instance).

Home, public, hashtag & list timelines accept these parameters:

- `only_media`: show only statuses with media attached
- `local`: show only local statuses
- `remote`: show only remote statuses

## Statuses

- `visibility`: has additional possible values `list` and `local` (for local-only statuses)

Has these additional fields under the `pleroma` object:

- `local`: true if the post was made on the local instance
- `conversation_id`: the ID of the AP context the status is associated with (if any)
- `direct_conversation_id`: the ID of the Mastodon direct message conversation the status is associated with (if any)
- `in_reply_to_account_acct`: the `acct` property of User entity for replied user (if any)
- `content`: a map consisting of alternate representations of the `content` property with the key being its mimetype. Currently, the only alternate representation supported is `text/plain`
- `spoiler_text`: a map consisting of alternate representations of the `spoiler_text` property with the key being its mimetype. Currently, the only alternate representation supported is `text/plain`
- `expires_at`: a datetime (iso8601) that states when the post will expire (be deleted automatically), or empty if the post won't expire
- `thread_muted`: true if the thread the post belongs to is muted
- `emoji_reactions`: A list with emoji / reaction maps. The format is `{name: "â˜•", count: 1, me: true}`. Contains no information about the reacting users, for that use the `/statuses/:id/reactions` endpoint.
- `parent_visible`: If the parent of this post is visible to the user or not.
- `pinned_at`: a datetime (iso8601) when status was pinned, `null` otherwise.

## Scheduled statuses

Has these additional fields in `params`:

- `expires_in`: the number of seconds the posted activity should expire in.

## Media Attachments

Has these additional fields under the `pleroma` object:

- `mime_type`: mime type of the attachment.

### Attachment cap

Some apps operate under the assumption that no more than 4 attachments can be returned or uploaded. Pleroma however does not enforce any limits on attachment count neither when returning the status object nor when posting.

### Limitations

Pleroma does not process remote images and therefore cannot include fields such as `meta` and `blurhash`. It does not support focal points or aspect ratios. The frontend is expected to handle it.

## Accounts

The `id` parameter can also be the `nickname` of the user. This only works in these endpoints, not the deeper nested ones for following etc.

- `/api/v1/accounts/:id`
- `/api/v1/accounts/:id/statuses`

`/api/v1/accounts/:id/statuses` endpoint accepts these parameters:

An endpoint to delete multiple statuses by IDs.

Required parameters:

## POST `/api/v1/statuses`

Additional parameters can be added to the JSON body/Form data:

### Pleroma Settings Store

Pleroma has mechanism that allows frontends to save blobs of json for each user on the backend. This can be used to save frontend-specific settings for a user that the backend does not need to know about.

The parameter should have a form of `{frontend_name: {...}}`, with `frontend_name` identifying your type of client, e.g. `pleroma_fe`. It will overwrite everything under this property, but will not overwrite other frontend's settings.

This information is returned in the `/api/v1/accounts/verify_credentials` endpoint.

## Authentication

## Streaming

### Chats

There is an additional `user:pleroma_chat` stream. Incoming chat messages will make the current chat be sent to this `user` stream. The `event` of an incoming chat message is `pleroma:chat_update`. The payload is the updated chat with the incoming chat message in the `last_message` field.

### Remote timelines

For viewing remote server timelines, there are `public:remote` and `public:remote:media` streams. Each of these accept a parameter like `?instance=lain.com`.

### Follow relationships updates

Pleroma streams follow relationships updates as `pleroma:follow_relationships_update` events to the `user` stream.

The message payload consist of:

- `state`: a relationship state, one of `follow_pending`, `follow_accept` or `follow_reject`.

- `follower` and `following` maps with following fields:
  - `id`: user ID
  - `follower_count`: follower count
  - `following_count`: following count

## User muting and thread muting

Both user muting and thread muting can be done for only a certain time by adding an `expires_in` parameter to the API calls and giving the expiration time in seconds.

## Not implemented

Pleroma is generally compatible with the Mastodon 2.7.2 API, but some newer features and non-essential features are omitted. These features usually return an HTTP 200 status code, but with an empty response. While they may be added in the future, they are considered low priority.
