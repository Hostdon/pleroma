If you are an instance admin and you want to modify the instace static files,
this is probably not the right place to do it. This directory is checked in
version control, so don't be surprised if you get merge conflicts after
modifying anything here.

Please use the instance static directory instead, it has the same directory
structure and files placed there will override files placed here. See
https://docs.akkoma.dev/main/backend/configuration/static_dir/ for more info.
