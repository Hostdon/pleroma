If you are an instance admin and you want to modify the instace static files, this is probably not the right place to do it. This directory is checked in version control, so don't be surprised if you get merge conflicts after modifying anything here. Please use instance static directory instead, it has the same directory structure and files placed there will override files placed here. See https://docs.pleroma.social/backend/configuration/static_dir/ for more info
