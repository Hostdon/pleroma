2. Restart Pleroma

## [2.0.0] - 2019-03-08
### Security
- Mastodon API: Fix being able to request enourmous amount of statuses in timelines leading to DoS. Now limited to 40 per request.

### Removed
- **Breaking**: Removed 1.0+ deprecated configurations `Pleroma.Upload, :strip_exif` and `:instance, :dedupe_media`

<details>
  <summary>API Changes</summary>
- **Breaking**: AdminAPI: migrate_from_db endpoint
</details>

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Pleroma won't start if it detects unapplied migrations
- **Breaking:** Elixir >=1.8 is now required (was >= 1.7)
- **Breaking:** `Pleroma.Plugs.RemoteIp` and `:rate_limiter` enabled by default. Please ensure your reverse proxy forwards the real IP!
- **Breaking:** attachment links (`config :pleroma, :instance, no_attachment_links` and `config :pleroma, Pleroma.Upload, link_name`) disabled by default
- **Breaking:** OAuth: defaulted `[:auth, :enforce_oauth_admin_scope_usage]` setting to `true` which demands `admin` OAuth scope to perform admin actions (in addition to `is_admin` flag on User); make sure to use bundled or newer versions of AdminFE & PleromaFE to access admin / moderator features.
- **Breaking:** Dynamic configuration has been rearchitected. The `:pleroma, :instance, dynamic_configuration` setting has been replaced with `config :pleroma, configurable_from_database`. Please backup your configuration to a file and run the migration task to ensure consistency with the new schema.
- **Breaking:** `:instance, no_attachment_links` has been replaced with `:instance, attachment_links` which still takes a boolean value but doesn't use double negative language.
- Replaced [pleroma_job_queue](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma_job_queue) and `Pleroma.Web.Federator.RetryQueue` with [Oban](https://github.com/sorentwo/oban) (see [`docs/config.md`](docs/config.md) on migrating customized worker / retry settings)
- Introduced [quantum](https://github.com/quantum-elixir/quantum-core) job scheduler
- Enabled `:instance, extended_nickname_format` in the default config
- Add `rel="ugc"` to all links in statuses, to prevent SEO spam
- Extract RSS functionality from OStatus
- MRF (Simple Policy): Also use `:accept`/`:reject` on the actors rather than only their activities
- OStatus: Extract RSS functionality
- Deprecated `User.Info` embedded schema (fields moved to `User`)
- Store status data inside Flag activity
- Deprecated (reorganized as `UserRelationship` entity) User fields with user AP IDs (`blocks`, `mutes`, `muted_reblogs`, `muted_notifications`, `subscribers`).
- Rate limiter is now disabled for localhost/socket (unless remoteip plug is enabled)
- Logger: default log level changed from `warn` to `info`.
- Config mix task `migrate_to_db` truncates `config` table before migrating the config file.
- Allow account registration without an email
- Default to `prepare: :unnamed` in the database configuration.
- Instance stats are now loaded on startup instead of being empty until next hourly job.

**OTP Note:** `pleroma_ctl` in 1.0 defaults to `master` and doesn't support specifying arbitrary branches, making `./pleroma_ctl update` fail. To fix this, fetch a version of `pleroma_ctl` from 1.1 using the command below and proceed with the update normally:
```
curl -Lo ./bin/pleroma_ctl 'https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/raw/develop/rel/files/bin/pleroma_ctl'
